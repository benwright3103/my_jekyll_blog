## First Week of Bootcamp 


This week I started my first week of Awesome Inc. coding bootcamp. It has been a fun, interesting and challenging week. At times I have felt brilliant at others, I couldn't have felt worse. Overall though I'd say it has a been an overwhelmingly positive experience. 

That being said, I was drawn to a coding bootcamp after being frustrated with my limited abilities to make websites function the way I wanted to, especially patterened after designs I had created.
